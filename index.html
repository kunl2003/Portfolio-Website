                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                   I’m Kunal Nayak, a passionate and results-driven B.Sc. IT graduate with a strong foundation in software development. Throughout my academic journey, I have developed skills in various programming languages such as Java, Python, JavaScript, PHP, C#, and SQL, and I am proficient with tools like IntelliJ IDEA, VSCode, and Visual Studio.

I have hands-on experience working on a wide range of projects, from developing personal portfolio websites to building robust applications like a Library Management System and an Online Quiz Application. These projects have allowed me to hone my skills in both frontend and backend development, working with technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Flask, MySQL, SQLite, and Java. My experience includes creating responsive, user-friendly interfaces, implementing complex database structures, and integrating various technologies to deliver functional and efficient software solutions.

I thrive in environments that challenge me to learn and grow. I am always looking to expand my knowledge, take on new projects, and collaborate with like-minded professionals. If you are looking for someone who brings a blend of creativity, technical expertise, and a willingness to learn, feel free to connect with me.
